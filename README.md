meta-template
=============

A template Yocto layer.

Maintained at https://github.com/Pelagicore/meta-template

Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on:
* meta-pelux (https://github.com/Pelagicore/meta-pelux)

Branching
---------
This repository will follow the Yocto release system. Whenever a new Yocto release
has been released, a new branch with the same name will be created from the master
branch. All feature growth should happen first on the master branch, but will also
be cherry-picked back to the latest Yocto release branch.

Security and bug fixes will be evaluated case by case and backported as necessary.
The ambition is to actively maintain the two latest releases and/or one-year-old
releases in this fashion.
